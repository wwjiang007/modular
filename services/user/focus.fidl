// This file has interfaces for 2 pieces of information: (1) The story
// that is currently in focus and (2) stories that are visible to the
// user. Names of interfaces follow the usual patterns:
//
// {Focus,VisibleStories}Controller is used by user shell to update
// information whenever changes take place.
//
// {Focus,VisibleStories}Provider is used by maxwell and usershell to
// query and get updates on which story is in focus on which device
// and visible stories on this device.
//
// NOTE(alhaad): The information about visible stories can be used by
// user runner to stop / pause stories that are not visible to the
// user.

// Implemented by user runner. Given to user shell in UserShell.Initialize().
interface FocusController {
  // Sets the focus on this device.

// Implemented by user shell. OnRequest() gets called whenever there
// is a new request to change focus on this device. Requests can be
// made via FocusProvider.Request().
interface FocusRequestWatcher {
  // TODO(mesch): This should be OnFocusRequest(), analog to
  // OnFocusChange(), such that multiple request watchers can be
  // implemented by the same client class.
  OnRequest(string story_id);
};

// Implemented by user runner. Given to user shell in
// UserShell.Initialize() and to Maxwell in
// maxwell.Launcher.Initialize(). Focus is persisted on the ledger.

 Watch(FocusWatcher watcher);

 // Requests user shell to change focus on this device. If user shell
 // responds to this request, focus shall be taken away from
 // previously focused story and an update will be sent on
 // FocusWatcher.OnFocusChange(). If |story_id| is NULL, the timeline
 // is brought back into focus.
 //
 // TODO(alhaad): Consider making this available for remote devices as
 // well.
