Modular
=======

Modular provides a framework for ephemerally downloaded applications which may
have been implemented in different programming languages to run in a shared
context and provide a composed experience to the user. The framework is also
responsible for application lifecycle, resource management, view hierarchy,
authentication, etc.

## Prerequisities

1. Follow instructions in [fuchsia](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/HEAD/README.md) for getting the source, setup, build and running Fuchsia. 
1. Follow instructions in [ledger](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/ledger/+/HEAD/docs/user_guide.md) to setup the Ledger and all its dependencies including netstack and minfs.

To run modules from the command line, you need to modify the startup behavior
of Fuchsia to prevent device_runner and Armadillo from starting by default.
Use fset and rebuild as shown below:

```sh
source fuchsia/scripts/env.sh
fset x86-64 --modules boot_headless
fbuild
```

## Running

*** promo
The examples below assume you are using the Fuchsia command line, the plain $.
If you see "magenta$", then switch to a Fuchsia tab.

You can start the basic test application like this.

```sh
device_runner --device_shell=dev_device_shell --user_shell=test_user_shell --user_shell_args=--test=0
```

A single application can be run using `dev_user_shell`. For example, to run
`example_flutter_counter_parent`, use this command:

```sh
device_runner --device_shell=dev_device_shell --user_shell=dev_user_shell --user_shell_args='--root_module=example_flutter_counter_parent,--root_link={"http://schema.domokit.org/counter":5}'
```

`dev_device_shell` is used to log in a dummy user directly without
going through an authentication dialog. `test_user_shell` runs the test.

Note: if you are running this through `netruncmd` you will need to double-escape
the quotes:

```sh
netruncmd : "@boot device_runner --device_shell=dev_device_shell --user_shell=dev_user_shell --user_shell_args='--root_module=example_flutter_counter_parent,--root_link={\\\"http://schema.domokit.org/counter\\\":5}'"
```

The flags `--user_shell` and `--user_shell_args` are read by `device_runner`.
The value of `--user_shell` is the application that is run as the user shell.
The value of `--user_shell_args` is a comma separated list of arguments passed
to the user shell application. In this example, these arguments are in turn more
flags.  Commas inside the value of such arguments are escaped by backslashes.
The value of `--root_module` selects the module to run. The value of
`--root_link` is a JSON representation of the initial data the module is started
with.

The user name provided by dev_device_shell can be set with `--user`. It is used
by device_runner when opening the Ledger.  However, the --user parameter does
not work for userpicker_device_shell:

```sh
device_runner --device_shell=dev_device_shell --device_shell_args=--user=dummy_user --user_shell=test_user_shell --user_shell_args=--test=0
```

## Module URLs

Applications are generally referenced by URLs. If the application binary is in a
location where application manager expects it (specifically `/system/apps`)
the URL can be relative. Otherwise, the URL should be relative with an absolute
path, or absolute altogether. For example
(from [test runner invocation](tests/parent_child/test.sh)):

```
device_runner --user_shell=dev_user_shell --user_shell_args=--root_module=/system/apps/modular_tests/parent_child/parent_module
```

or even more generally:

```
device_runner --user_shell=dev_user_shell --user_shell_args=--root_module=file:///system/apps/modular_tests/parent_child/parent_module
```
