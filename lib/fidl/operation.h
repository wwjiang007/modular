// Something that can be put in an OperationContainer until it calls
// Done() on itself. Used to implement asynchronous operations that
// need to hold on to handles until the operation asynchronously
// completes and returns a value.
//
// Held by a unique_ptr<> in the OperationContainer, so instances of
// derived classes need to be created with new.
//
// Advantages of using an Operation instance to implement asynchronous
// fidl method invocations:
//
//  1. It's possible in the first place. To receive the return
//     callback, the interface pointer on which the method is invoked
//     needs to be kept around. An instance allows this, but it's
//     tricky to place a move-only interface pointer on the capture
//     list of a lambda passed as argument to its own method.
//
//  2. The capture list of the callbacks only holds this, everything
//     else that needs to be passed on is in the instance.
//
//  3. Completion callbacks don't need to be made copyable and don't
//     need to be mutable, because no move only pointer is pulled from
//     their capture list.
//
//  4. Conversion of Handle to Ptr can be done by Bind() because the
//     Ptr is already there.
